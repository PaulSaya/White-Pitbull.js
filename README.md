Is the white Pitbull a rare color, or are they just as common as the rest? Some breeders charge more for a Pitbull with a white coat, but whatâ€™s the reasoning behind that? Pitbulls with white coats inherit that color from birth, and are often bred by breeders specifically for this reason. Just make sure that your pup is actually a White Pitbull and not a Dogo Argentino that looks very similar.

The American Pitbull Terrier actually has a wide variety of coat colors to choose from. From silver, fawn, brindle or reverse brindle, red, or blue, he pretty much has a choice of the whole doggy rainbow spectrum. And one of the most beautiful and popular colors of them all is brilliant white.
